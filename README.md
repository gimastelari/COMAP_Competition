# COMAP_Competition

COMAP Mathematical Modeling Competition 2025 at Southern CT State University

Research Goal: 
To identify what makes a strong cybersecurity policy? 

Questions Explored:  
1. What is common between successful cybercrimes? Unsuccessful? 
2. How are cybercrimes distributed internationally?
     a. Are certain countries targeted more than others? Why?
3. How do national cybersecurity policies differ between:
   *  Countries targetted more often vs less often
   *  Bigger countries vs smaller countries?
5. What national demographics (e.g. access to internet, wealth, education levels, etc.) correlate with your cybercrime distribution analysis?
     a. How might these support (or conflate with) your theory?
6. What limitations/concerns should policy makers consider when relying on your work to develop/refine their national cybersecurity policies?
