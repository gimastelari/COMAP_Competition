COMAP Mathematical Modeling Competition 2025 at Southern CT State University

Research Questions: 
1. What is common between successful cybercrimes?
2. How are cybercrimes distributed internationally?
     a. Are certain countries targeted more than others? Why?
3. How do international cybersecurity policies differ between countries targetted more often vs less often and bigger countries vs smaller countries?
4. What national demographics (e.g. access to internet, wealth, education levels, etc.) correlate with your cybercrime distribution analysis?
     a. How might these support (or conflate with) your theory?
5. What limitations/concerns should policy makers consider when relying on your work to develop/refine their national cybersecurity policies?
